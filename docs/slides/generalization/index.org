* Common experimental scenarios

Commonly subjects are asked to:

- name words / make lexical decisions
- judge the trustworthiness of faces
- read/rate stories or scenarios
- remember or make judgments about scenes

#+begin_notes
- most people worry a lot about the quality of their stimuli
- and worry about generalizing beyond the sample of subjects
- but (outside psycholing) rare to worry about whether findings will
  generalize beyond their stimuli
#+end_notes

* The "Language-As-Fixed-Effect" Fallacy

- Psycholinguistic experiments sample language materials as well as subjects
- Language stimuli should be treated as a random, not fixed factor
- Clark's suggestion: \(F'\), min-\(F'\)

* Problems with min-\(F'\)

- Low power (Forster & Dickinson, 1978)
  - especially when critical variances are small
  - alternative \(F_1 \times F_2\) criterion is powerful, but invalid

- Inherits limitations from ANOVA
  - categorical IVs, continuous DVs
  - problems with unbalanced data

* Linear mixed-effects models

- /simultaneously/ accounts for subjects + stimuli
- allows continuous & categorical predictors
- better handling of unbalanced data
- estimated using *=lme4=* and *=brms=* (R), *=MixedModels.jl=* (Julia), *=PyMC3=* (Python)
- BUT: technically demanding, and estimation is iterative (MLE) so may not converge

- todo: explain random intercepts and random slopes
#+end_notes

* Some myths

1. A "random intercepts only" model is sufficient
2. Only a problem for psycholinguists
3. Matching stimuli solves the problem
4. Same stimuli across conditions solves the problem 
5. Bigger N/replication solves the problem

* 1. Random intercepts only?

- random intercepts only assumes /effect homogeneity/ for within-unit effects

- In ANOVA, by-subject random slope variance is accounted for by aggregation or by the "treatment-by-subject" error term

- "keep it maximal" strategy: all within-unit effects with multiple observations per cell get a random slope

#+begin_notes
- in other words: that an effect shows zero variability for all participants; exhaustively described by a constant

* Design-driven or data-driven?

- Matuschek et al. argue for data-driven random effects
- Can boost power when random slope variance is small
- However, outside of simple cases with conservative criteria, risk is
  unknown

* 2. Only a problem for psycholinguists?

* generalizing over encounters

The target of inference in much of psychology and related fields has
been misidentified as a population of /subjects/ or /stimuli/, when the
actual target of inference is a population of events: *encounters*

#+begin_smaller
- readers encountering particular types of words
- male participants judging attractiveness of female faces, or vice versa
- gamers encountering particular types of violent games
- audience members encountering particular types of dance movements
- insomniacs (versus controls) encountering emotional expressions
- birds hearing particular types of birdsongs

  would have been missed by modeling subject variability only

* 3. Matching stimuli?

- use NHST to show no difference between materials forming your two conditions?
  - e.g., word frequency not significantly different for your two stimulus sets
- PROBLEM: impossible to perfectly equate stimuli, stimulus sets repeat /with each new subject/ that is added

#+end_citation

* 4. Same stimuli across conditions?

Using the same stimuli across conditions only controls for influence of by-item random intercept variance on your effect of interest, *not* any by-item random slope variance!

* 5. Replication? Big N?

#+begin_center
/Instead of by-subjects analysis, why not just replicate?/
#+end_center

- Successful replication with *the same stimuli* ambiguous between replicating stimulus biases and demonstrating robustness
- True effect with *different stimuli* may yield highly significant effects across studies but in /conflicting/ directions

[[file:img/subject_n.png]]

* Why mixed-effects models are great

- Extremely flexible, can handle many research designs and data types
- Give insight into variability at multiple levels (subject, item, trial)
- Represent a /full generative model/ of the data
  - thus allow better grasp on power
- Allow simultaneous generalization over multiple sampling units

#+begin_notes
- increase subject N or item N?
#+end_notes

* Why mixed-effects models are not so great

- Extremely flexible, easy to misuse
- Reporting standards: Still the Wild West
- Convergence problems can be frustrating
  - BUT: see *=MixedModels.jl=* and *=brms=*

* Solutions other than mixed-effects models

- Use a *very* large number of stimuli
- Use different stimuli for each subject
- Use a very *small* number and call it a case study
- Add /...for these stimuli/ to the title of your paper

* The tip of the iceberg?

#+begin_center
Also need to consider other factors than just /stimuli/ and /subjects/
#+end_center

- construct operationalization
- task (e.g., ego depletion)
