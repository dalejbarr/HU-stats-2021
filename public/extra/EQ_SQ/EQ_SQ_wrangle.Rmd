# Instructions

Edit this file with your answers, replacing any `NULL` values with your solution code and adding any additional code that you need. 

# Some things you'll need to know

- working with dates (`vignette("lubridate")`)
- dplyr windowed functions (`vignette("window-functions")`), particularly `group_by() %>% filter()`
- RMarkdown inline code; see [RMarkdown cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.org/links/r_markdown_cheat_sheet)
- using `dplyr::recode()`

# Data

Data in the files [empathizing.csv](empathizing.csv) and [systemizing.csv](systemizing.csv) are responses to the short forms of the [Empathy Quotient and Systemizing Quotient short forms](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2006.03.017).

The variable `user_id` is the participant's unique ID, while the variable `id` is a unique ID for that questionnaire completion. Some participants completed both questionnaires on the same day, others only completed one, others completed the questionnaires multiple times. The columns `starttime` and `endtime` contain the timestamps for when each questionnaire was started and completed.

*Scoring*: An individual scores two points if they strongly display a systemizing/empathizing response, and one point if they slightly display a systemizing/empathizing response (i.e., each forward (F) item scored 2, 1, 0, 0; each reversed (R) item scored 0, 0, 1, 2). 

In the data files, responses were coded as follows:

* 1 = Strongly agree
* 2 = Slightly agree
* 3 = Slightly disagree
* 4 = Strongly disagree

# Assignment

Answer the following questions by editing the code block below each question.

Note: please enter the *code* that generates the correct answer; don't simply type in the numbers.  The code should give the right answers even if the source data files change (new rows of values are added or subtracted).

Setup block.  Load any add-on packages you need here.  

```{r setup}
## TODO: library(something)
```

## Loading and inspecting files

1. Load in the two CSV files.  How many times were the empathizing and systemizing questionnaires completed? Save these as the variables:

    * `emp_total_n` 
    * `sys_total_n`

```{r P1}
## TODO: read the data

emp_total_n <- NULL
sys_total_n <- NULL
```

## Calculating durations

How long did it take people to complete each questionnaire? 

2. Create the following variables:

* `mean_emp` = mean duration (in seconds) for empathizing questionnaire (before exclusions)
* `sd_emp` = SD of duration (in seconds) for empathizing questionnaire (before exclusions)
* `mean_sys` = mean duration (in seconds) for systemizing questionnaire (before exclusions)
* `sd_sys` = SD of duration (in seconds) for systemizing questionnaire (before exclusions)

```{r P2}
## add any additional code you need

mean_emp <- NULL
sd_emp <- NULL
mean_sys <- NULL
sd_sys <- NULL
```

3. Graph the distributions <ins>of duration</ins> for each questionnaire after excluding times that are more than 3 SDs above the mean for each questionnaire. 

```{r P3}
## TODO: create a graph
```

## Questionnaire completion

4. How many people completed both questionnaires *for the first time* on the same day? Save this number as  `first_time_n`.

**Remember to check for people who completed a questionnaire more than once.**

```{r P4}
## add any additional code you need

first_time_n <- NULL
```

## Respondent demographics

5. Create a table of demographic information by sex with the columns 
`sex`, `n`, `mean age`, `sd age`, and `number missing age`, only for people who completed both questionnaires for the first time on the same day (i.e., use the data table you created for question <del>3</del><ins>4</ins>). Save the table as `demog_table`.

```{r P5}
## add any additional code you need

demog_table <- NULL
```

6. What is wrong with the SD? Address it by changing implausible ages to `NA` and re-calcuating the table above, saving it as `demog_table_fixed`.

```{r P6}
## add any additional code you need

demog_table_fixed <- NULL
```

## Exclusions

If someone takes less than 30 seconds to fill out the questionnaire or gives the same reponse for every question, we can assume they aren't taking the study seriously.  

7. Filter out non-serious responders <ins>from the data table you created for question 4</ins>. Store the resulting data in the variable named `emp_sys_cleaned`.  You will use this as the source table in later problems.

```{r P7}
## add any additional code you need

emp_sys_cleaned <- NULL
```

8. Create the following variables:
 
- `excluded_short` = How many people took less than 30 seconds on at least one questionnaire? 
- `excluded_one` = How many people gave the same response to each question in at least one questionnaire?
- `excluded_total` = How many people are you excluding in total?
    
```{r P8}
## add any additional code you need

excluded_short <- NULL

excluded_one <- NULL

excluded_total <- NULL
```
    
    
9. Write up your exclusion criteria and numbers of participants excluded as if for the methods section of a paper.  Use inline code to generate any numbers used in your description; don't just type them.

## Create EQ and SQ scores

Calculate the EQ and SQ scores from the questionnaire responses.
    
Remember that forward coded (F) questions are coded: 
    
(1) strongly agree = 2
(2) slightly agree = 1
(3) slightly disagree = 0
(4) strongly disagree = 0
    
while reverse-coded (R) questions are coded: 
    
(1) strongly agree = 0
(2) slightly agree = 0
(3) slightly disagree = 1
(4) strongly disagree = 2

10. Create a table of mean EQ and SQ by sex and save it as `EQ_SQ_scores`. Include the columns `sex`, `n`, `mean_EQ`, `mean_SQ`, `missing_EQ`, and `missing_SQ` (how many people have a missing score).

```{r P10}
## add any additional code you need

EQ_SQ_scores <- NULL
```


11. Write code to re-create the following graph of the EQ and SQ score distributions for men and women.
